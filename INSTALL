Notes on building MilkyTracker
==============================

MilkyTracker now uses CMake to produce the build files.  This replaces
the previously separately maintained Autotools, Visual Studio and
XCode project files.  Some histroic platform-specific build files
remain in the platforms directory - these are untested.

The cmake configuration will auto-detect the platform it is building
on, but can be configured to force an SDL build if required.


Dependencies
============

To build the SDL port of MilkyTracker you will need the following
development libraries:

- ALSA (optional, needed for Linux MIDI support)
- RtMidi (for Linux MIDI support)
- JACK (optional)
- SDL2

For all non-windows ports, the decompression libs (optional):

- lhasa
- zlib
- zziplib

These are also provided as git submodules, see below.


Submodules
==========

The following git submodules are provided for linking into the Windows
binary:

- RtAudio
- lhasa
- zlib
- zziplib

To obtain these, 'cd' to the MilkyTracker source directory and type:

 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
