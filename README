About
=====

MilkyTracker is an multi-platform music application for creating .MOD
and .XM module files. It attempts to recreate the module replay and
user experience of the popular DOS program Fasttracker II, with
special playback modes available for improved Amiga ProTracker 2/3
compatibility.

Notes on building MilkyTracker
==============================

There are currently 3 different build systems being actively maintained:

- OSX: XCode (Cocoa and SDL variants)
- Unix: Autoconf/Automake (using SDL 2)
- Windows: Visual Studio (DevCPP has been used for older releases)

IDE project files can be found in the 'platforms' directory.  The
remainder of this document describes the Autoconf/Automake build
system.

If you have obtained the MilkyTracker sources from the version control
repository, the autotools generated files (INSTALL, configure, etc) will
be missing. To obtain these either generate them using 'autoreconf -i'
(requires autoconf/automake to be installed) or obtain them from the
release package.

See INSTALL for a more general explanation of how 'configure' works.

You will also need to obtain RTAudio and RTMidi, which we provide as git
submodules. To do this, 'cd' to the MilkyTracker source directory and use:

 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update

The configure scripts try to check for everything needed and will also
auto-detect ALSA and JACK adding support automatically; However, this
behaviour can be over-ridden using the following arguments to configure:

 --with-alsa | --with-jack
   Force build to use alsa/jack, build will fail if not found.
 --without-alsa | --without-jack
   Disable alsa/jack support.

Note that the configure scripts plus associated Makefiles are designed
to build the SDL version of MilkyTracker only.


Dependencies
============

To build MilkyTracker you will need the following development libraries:

- ALSA (optional)
- JACK (optional)
- SDL
- libz

Note to package maintainers: MilkyTracker contains an internal copy of
libzzip that has been modified for use with MilkyTracker; An externally
linked libzzip will not work correctly (ZIP support will be broken).
